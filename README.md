## About The Project

I wanted to test my CSS skills and see if I can replicate the github webstite styling.

I decided to add a twist to the project and use an API the give random commits **[WhatTheCommit](http://whatthecommit.com/)**
But appearently making requests to this API is no longer possible and now it's a VS code extention.
So I took the inspration from this **[WhatTheCommit](http://whatthecommit.com/)**

And I decided to make some random commit messages of my own!

This was a fun project I made in my free time and enjoyed it a lot.

Maybe one day I will turn this into an API myself.
